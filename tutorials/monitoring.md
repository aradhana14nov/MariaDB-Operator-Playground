### Enable Monitoring service on MariaDB 

Step1: Create below yaml to create CR for MariaDB Monitoring services.

```execute
cat <<'EOF'> MariaDBmonitoring.yaml
apiVersion: mariadb.persistentsys/v1alpha1
kind: Monitor
metadata:
  name: mariadb-monitor
spec:
  # Add fields here
  size: 1
  # Database source to connect with for colleting metrics
  # Format: "<db-user>:<db-password>@(<dbhost>:<dbport>)/<dbname>">
  # Make approprite changes 
  dataSourceName: "root:password@(##DNS.ip##:30685)/test-db"
  # Image name with version
  # Refer https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter for more details
  image: "prom/mysqld-exporter"
EOF
```

Note: The database host and port should be correct for metrics to work.


Step2: Execute below command to Create Instance of Monitoring 

```execute
kubectl create -f MariaDBmonitoring.yaml -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```

This CR will start Prometheus exporter pod and service. 



## Create monitoring resources :

To enable monitoring services, you need to :

1. Install Prometheus Operator and Deploy Prometheus Instance and ServiceMonitor 

2. Install Grafana Operator and Deploy Grafana Server Instance and Grafana Data-Source

If above prerequisites are already fullfilled, you can proceed with Step2 and Step4.

Else proceed as follows: 


### Step 1: Install Prometheus operator and Deploy Prometheus Instance and ServiceMonitor :
 
 Please go to Prometheus operator tutorial.


### Step 2: Verify prometheus monitoring metrics :


Verify metrics are present at [http://##DNS.ip##:30100](http://##DNS.ip##:30100/)



### Step 3: Install Grafana Operator and Deploy Grafana Server and Gafana Data-Source: 


Please go to Grafana Operator tutorial 



### Step 4: Verify Grafana dashboard is accessible


Verify Grafana Dashboard is accessible at [http://##DNS.ip##:30101](http://##DNS.ip##:30101/)
